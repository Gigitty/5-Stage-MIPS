# 5-Stage-MIPS
5-Stage MIPS Pipelined Processor in Verilog
This project introduces a practical exploration into the development of a 5-stage MIPS processor using Verilog and Vivado, with a focus on its implementation feasibility on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Detailing the specifics of each stage – fetching, decoding, executing, memory accessing, and write-back – the project delves into the technical nuances of the processor's Verilog implementation. Vivado, as the chosen development tool, is instrumental in the synthesis and implementation processes, translating abstract code into a concrete and functional design. The FPGA serves as the hardware platform, providing flexibility for the MIPS processor to adjust to various computing demands. This project aims to contribute valuable insights into real-world applications of a Verilog-based 5-stage MIPS processor, emphasizing its potential impact on computational efficiency and adaptability within FPGA architectures.
