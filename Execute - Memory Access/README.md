During the Execute to Memory Access stage of the processor pipeline, the focus shifts from the execution of the instruction to potential interactions with the system's memory. For instructions that interact with memory (e.g., load or store operations), the effective memory address is computed. This involves combining the base address with any offset or displacement specified in the instruction. Once the memory address is computed, a request is sent to the memory subsystem to either read data from or write data to the specified memory location. The memory access may involve fetching data from memory or storing computed results back to memory. If the instruction requires loading data from memory, the fetched data is moved to the designated registers within the processor. Similarly, for store operations, the data to be stored is moved from registers to the memory location.
