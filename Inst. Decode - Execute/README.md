From the Instruction Decode to the Execute stage of the processor, the focus is on preparing for its actual execution. If the instruction involves arithmetic or logic operations, these calculations are performed by the designated execution unit, often an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The result is computed based on the opcode and operands fetched in the previous stages.
